# EIGRP Classic Authentication

- Two types of authentication supported
  - MD5
  - HMAC-SHA-256

  - MD5 Authentication
    - Both classical and Named EIGRP
    - Uses Key Chains
    - Supports automatic key rotation
  - SHA Authentication
    - Only Named EIGRP
    - No key chains, no rotation
  - Key Rotation
    - Key chain supports multiple key numbers
      - Router always sends lowest valid key
    - Key number's validity is based on time
      - accept-lifetime
        - When is key valid to be received
      - send-lifetime
        - When is key valid to be sent
    - Automatic rotation by defining different validity times
      - Implies time must be agreed upon
      - accept lifetime should overlap in case of mismatch of time

- Classic EIGRP Authentication
  - Supports MD5 only
  - Define key chain globally
    - Whitespace counts as character
    - Key number must match
    - Supports automatic key rotation
  - Configuration
    - conf t
      - key chain [name]
        - key 1
          - key-string [password]
      - int [interface]
        - ip authentication mode eigrp [as] md5
        - ip authentication key-chain eigrp [as] [key-chain]
  - Key Rotation Config
    - 
  - Validation
    - show run | sec key
    - show key chain
